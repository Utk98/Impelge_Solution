The program implements a trie data structure to efficiently store and search for words. It reads a list of words from a file, inserts them into the trie, and identifies the longest and second longest compound words. The use of a trie allows for efficient prefix matching and compound word identification.

The main steps include:

Reading words from a file and inserting them into the trie.
Building a queue of word suffixes based on prefixes found in the trie.
Processing the word suffixes queue to identify compound words, updating the longest and second longest as needed.
Printing the results along with the time taken to process the file.
The program effectively utilizes trie data structures and queues to achieve efficient compound word identification.
