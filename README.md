 C++ program designed to read a file containing a list of words and identify the longest and second longest compound words in the list. Here's an overview of the code:

Trie Implementation:
   - The code defines a Trie data structure to efficiently store and search for words.
   - Each node in the Trie is represented by the `TrieNode` class, containing information about the character, whether it is the end of a word, and sets of words and child nodes.
   - The `Trie` class contains methods for inserting a word into the Trie, checking if a word is present, and retrieving all prefixes of a word.

2. Main Function:
   - The program utilizes a `Trie` to store words read from a file.
   - It initializes a queue (`wordSuffixes`) to handle word suffixes later in the process.
   - The main loop reads words from the input file, inserts them into the Trie, and adds word suffixes to the queue.
   - After reading the file, the program processes the word suffixes queue to identify the longest and second longest compound words.
   - The results, including the longest and second longest compound words, are then printed along with the time taken to process the file.

3. Execution Flow:
   - The program reads words from the file and inserts them into the Trie.
   - For each word, it finds all prefixes in the Trie and adds corresponding word suffixes to the queue.
   - The program then iterates over the word suffixes queue, checking if the suffix is a valid word in the Trie.
   - If it is a valid word, the program updates the longest and second longest compound words.
   - If not, it continues the process by finding prefixes of the remaining suffix.

4. Result:
   - The program prints the longest and second longest compound words found in the input file, along with the time taken to process the file.
